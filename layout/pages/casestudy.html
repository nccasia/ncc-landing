                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team
                            is active in implementing, creating test case and
                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                            affect the progress of project. With this
                            professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                            become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.

                            Base on the professional experience on fintech
                            industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members
                            including PM, Technical Leader, BA, Developers, QA,
                            DevOps. The tickets in project were devided into two
                            main flows, the first one for ETL sub-team and the
                            second one for backend& frontend. The ETL sub-team
                            was in charged of checking and finding fintech
                            companies that have not been added to DB via client
                            source and external source via AWS. The backend &
                            frontend focused on displaying the fintech companies
                            that have not been added to internal database.
                            Testers in the ETL folow needed to query data in DB
                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team
                            is active in implementing, creating test case and
                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                            affect the progress of project. With this
                            professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                            become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.

                            industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members
                            including PM, Technical Leader, BA, Developers, QA,
                            DevOps. The tickets in project were devided into two
                            main flows, the first one for ETL sub-team and the
                            second one for backend& frontend. The ETL sub-team
                            was in charged of checking and finding fintech
                            companies that have not been added to DB via client
                            source and external source via AWS. The backend &
                            frontend focused on displaying the fintech companies
                            that have not been added to internal database.
                            Testers in the ETL folow needed to query data in DB
                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team
                            is active in implementing, creating test case and
                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                            affect the progress of project. With this
                            professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                            become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.

                            industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members

                            DevOps. The tickets in project were devided into two
                            main flows, the first one for ETL sub-team and the
                            second one for backend& frontend. The ETL sub-team
                            was in charged of checking and finding fintech
                            companies that have not been added to DB via client
                            source and external source via AWS. The backend &
                            frontend focused on displaying the fintech companies
                            that have not been added to internal database.
                            Testers in the ETL folow needed to query data in DB
                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team

                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not

                            Base on the professional experience on fintech
                            industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members
                            including PM, Technical Leader, BA, Developers, QA,
                            DevOps. The tickets in project were devided into two
                            main flows, the first one for ETL sub-team and the
                            second one for backend& frontend. The ETL sub-team
                            was in charged of checking and finding fintech
                            companies that have not been added to DB via client
                            source and external source via AWS. The backend &
                            frontend focused on displaying the fintech companies
                            that have not been added to internal database.
                            Testers in the ETL folow needed to query data in DB
                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team
                            is active in implementing, creating test case and
                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                            affect the progress of project. With this
                            professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                            become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.

                            industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members
                            including PM, Technical Leader, BA, Developers, QA,
                            DevOps. The tickets in project were devided into two
                            main flows, the first one for ETL sub-team and the
                            second one for backend& frontend. The ETL sub-team
                            was in charged of checking and finding fintech
                            companies that have not been added to DB via client
                            source and external source via AWS. The backend &
                            frontend focused on displaying the fintech companies
                            that have not been added to internal database.
                            Testers in the ETL folow needed to query data in DB
                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team
                            is active in implementing, creating test case and
                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                            affect the progress of project. With this
                            professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                            become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.

                            Base on the professional experience on fintech
                            industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members
                            including PM, Technical Leader, BA, Developers, QA,
                            DevOps. The tickets in project were devided into two
                            main flows, the first one for ETL sub-team and the
                            second one for backend& frontend. The ETL sub-team
                            was in charged of checking and finding fintech
                            companies that have not been added to DB via client
                            source and external source via AWS. The backend &
                            frontend focused on displaying the fintech companies
                            that have not been added to internal database.
                            Testers in the ETL folow needed to query data in DB
                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team
                            is active in implementing, creating test case and
                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                            affect the progress of project. With this
                            professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                            become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.

                            industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members
                            including PM, Technical Leader, BA, Developers, QA,
                            DevOps. The tickets in project were devided into two
                            main flows, the first one for ETL sub-team and the
                            second one for backend& frontend. The ETL sub-team
                            was in charged of checking and finding fintech
                            companies that have not been added to DB via client
                            source and external source via AWS. The backend &
                            frontend focused on displaying the fintech companies
                            that have not been added to internal database.
                            Testers in the ETL folow needed to query data in DB
                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team
                            is active in implementing, creating test case and
                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                            affect the progress of project. With this
                            professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                            become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.

                            Base on the professional experience on fintech
                            industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members
                            including PM, Technical Leader, BA, Developers, QA,
                            DevOps. The tickets in project were devided into two
                            main flows, the first one for ETL sub-team and the
                            second one for backend& frontend. The ETL sub-team
                            was in charged of checking and finding fintech
                            companies that have not been added to DB via client
                            source and external source via AWS. The backend &
                            frontend focused on displaying the fintech companies
                            that have not been added to internal database.
                            Testers in the ETL folow needed to query data in DB
                            to compare with data API returned to each company.
                            In the Frontend& Backend flow, they had to double
                            check the features sharing functions such as
                            realtime company, filter in other features to assure
                            that there is no mistake with the current data flow.
                            The main issue in most of tasks is depending on data
                            from external API so if there was a wrong external
                            data the team would have to detech and check all of
                            data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                            out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the team
                            is active in implementing, creating test case and
                            follow data in advance so that can take time and
                            have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                            affect the progress of project. With this
                            professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                            become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.
