                              Base on the professional experience on fintech
                              industry, NCC formed a team of 20 skilled members
                              including PM, Technical Leader, BA, Developers,
                              QA, DevOps. The tickets in project were devided
                              into two main flows, the first one for ETL
                              sub-team and the second one for backend& frontend.
                              The ETL sub-team was in charged of checking and
                              finding fintech companies that have not been added
                              to DB via client source and external source via
                              AWS. The backend & frontend focused on displaying
                              the fintech companies that have not been added to
                              internal database. Testers in the ETL folow needed
                              to query data in DB to compare with data API
                              returned to each company. In the Frontend& Backend
                              flow, they had to double check the features
                              sharing functions such as realtime company, filter
                              in other features to assure that there is no
                              mistake with the current data flow. The main issue
                              in most of tasks is depending on data from
                              external API so if there was a wrong external data
                              the team would have to detech and check all of
                              data flow of ETL and Frontend & Backend to figure
                              out the mistake. To handle this challenge, the
                              team is active in implementing, creating test case
                              and follow data in advance so that can take time
                              and have plan to solve the arising problem but not
                              affect the progress of project. With this
                              professional and effective working manner, NCC has
                              become the trusted partner of client for 3 years.
