                    We understand that solidarity is one of the most important
                    factors which determine the success of any organization.
                    Since the extremely rapid and powerful development of
                    technology, it is not possible for an individual to keep up
                    and cover all the movements and improvements, therefore, to
                    provide diverse and comprehensive services, NCC always
                    strives to strengthen the spirit of solidarity and
                    cooperative attitude of all members in the company.
